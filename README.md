# JoelKit

The goal of this repository is to implement CS theory (algorithms, data structures) from first principles so I understand it deeply.

The python code is in the `python` folder, which is also a python package installable by `pip install joelkit`

The C++ code is in the `c++` folder. To "install" it, just download the .h and .cpp files that you want and #include it into your project.

The theory page includes pseudocode in markdown files as well as proofs in .jpg images.
